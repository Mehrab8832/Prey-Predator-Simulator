A predator-prey simulation involving multiple animals and a single plant species in
an enclosed rectangular field. Animals are split into predators and preys, where predators
eat prey and prey eat plants. Each species have different times of sleep, breeding ages, 
maximum ages, etc. Animals have genders which can determine they breeding opportunities. 
Plants can spawn disease and spread it to animals via (and other grass via breeding) as
prey can eat the grass, then they can be spread by being eaten or breeding. The simulation also
has weather that lasts 1 - 10 hours that determines the behaviour of the actors, such as rainy 
weather making grass breed more often.
